# AnuralForSchool
Includes Anural but it has my school's policies

## If you for some reason want to use my schools policies, here you go.

- Press `Ctrl + Alt + F2 (Arrow above 2)`
- Run `root`
- Run `curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dddpwpp/AnuralForSchool/patch-1/Anural.sh`
- Go to `chrome://policy` and it should be changed
- If it didn't change then press `Alt + Volume up + X`
- Done.

--I don't plan on making this for RootFS
